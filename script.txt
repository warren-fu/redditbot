AITA for telling our landlord about his daughter’s plans?
I live in an apartment with two other people, one of which is the daughter of the landlord, let’s say Hannah.
She is moving to another apartment the is closer to her university the first of may. The landlord already has another tenant that will move in the first of may, that we already met and who we like. So far no problems.
I had a conversation with Hannah this weekend and she told me she is planning to take most of the furniture in the living room and most kitchen stuff with her, including the tv, couch, plates & cutlery and kitchen appliances. I didn’t ask of say anything then and maybe I should’ve.
The thing is that my other roommate and I pay a little more rent for an apartment with “fully furnished living room and kitchen” this is on paper in the rental agreement.
So yesterday I emailed our landlord and politely asked what his ideas are about the furniture, if he would replace things, if we should do it ourself but we would be compensated, or rent lowered and just generally what would happen.
Today Hannah came up to me very angry because “I went behind her back and tattled on her” to her dad. Apparently her dad forbade her from taking the stuff she wanted to. Now she could only take the stuff from her bedroom and a couple of small things from the living room/kitchen.
She is mad I didn’t talk to her because “I went behind her back”, “we could’ve come to an agreement” and “I ruined her move because she couldn’t afford a lot of furniture”.
I feel like I maybe should’ve talked to her but I mostly feel like I have an agreement with the landlord (her dad) and not with her and I didn’t want to be involved in their business.
But AITA and should I have done things different?
